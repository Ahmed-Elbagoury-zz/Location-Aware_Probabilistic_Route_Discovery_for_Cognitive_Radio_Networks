# Location-Aware_Probabilistic_Route_Discovery_for_Cognitive_Radio_Networks
Implementation of location aware probabilistic route discovery for cognitive radio networks. If you will use it please cite the following paper:
  Elbagoury, Ahmed, Ahmed Saeed, and Moustafa Youssef. "Location-aware probabilistic route discovery for cognitive radio networks." Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), 2014 IEEE. IEEE, 2014.

The implementation modifies the some files in NS2 to support multi-channel. The implementation of the routing algorithm is in "src/aodv/" directory.
